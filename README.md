# 🕊️ Operation Navjeevan

## 📖 Overview

**Operation Navjeevan** is a humanitarian data analysis and simulation project.

This project simulates real-world, data-driven decision-making for humanitarian relief during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It uses core Python concepts—including mutable and immutable objects, sets, tuples, lists, and dictionaries—to support the Indian Taskforce for Emergency Relief in managing aid distribution to affected Ukrainian cities.

You take on the role of an advanced intelligence agent, tasked with analyzing mission-critical data to determine high-alert zones and deliver life-saving supplies efficiently.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Clean and Sort Aid Requests**  
  Remove duplicates and alphabetize lists of cities needing aid.

- 🚨 **Identify High-Alert Zones**  
  Perform set operations to determine urgent cities based on multiple intelligence sources.

- 🧠 **City-Level Intelligence Mapping**  
  Construct a dictionary with population and aid data for high-alert cities. Compute total aid needs and affected population.

- 📦 **Track Supply Distribution**  
  Use nested dictionaries to track types and quantities of aid sent to Ukrainian and Russian cities.
